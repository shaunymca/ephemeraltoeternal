## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# add a dotenv file
You'll need to add a `.env` file to root folder? Include the connection details like below:
`DATABASE_URL=<your database uri>`
`PGSSLMODE=require`

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
